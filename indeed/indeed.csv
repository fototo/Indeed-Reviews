Working at Starbucks helped me learn how to communicate with customers at a work environment and how to constructively work with others to get task done.  I spent my day on register making customers experience quick and enjoying.  I also worked on the bar  making drinks for customers.  Mornings were the hardest because of the business and dealing with cranky customers but I still managed to smile and efficiently get their orders to them.  Most enjoyable part was being able to enjoy a frappe and brownie on my break that was my day.,Barista/Cashier,Starbucks,It was a productive and learning experience working there.,"100 West 33rd Street, New York, NY 10001","April 3, 2017",NA,NA

"A typical day at work was fun and exhausting at the same time. Working for this company taught me real patience. Upper management was not supportive to the needs, ideas, or feelings of the partners. I didnt like all of my co-workers the same but they were a nice group of people. The hardest part of the job was being belittled, lied to and strung along by mangement. The most enjoyable part of my job was to know that when my fellow patrners and customers saw me at work that they had no worries about it being a great shift/day or there drink being made right or about being greeted with a warm smile and having a great day.",barista,Starbucks,fun place to work,"Highland, CA","April 10, 2012","learning new things every 6 months, being able to try new thing","short breaks, buying own uniforms"

Starbucks is a fast paced environment. Our main goal was to enrich people's daily lives. This job has taught me patience and perseverance.

"A typical day at work would include large amounts of cleaning (I am usually working a closing shift), and setting up for the next day. However, when I did work mornings or mid shifts, I would usually be the barista making drinks and passing them off to customers. It takes a certain talent to be able to make beverages at the customers' desired speed, and with the quality that Starbucks expects, but I consider myself to be fairly good at what I do on my shift. Co-workers can be hit and miss, I am usually one to stay out of drama and things associated with other people at work, but I also have some good friends at my workplaces that I have made over the years. The biggest obstacle I have run into when at work is dealing with the management, because in my three years' experience working at multiple stores, I have worked with probably only one manager that I believe deserved the title of her position. I hardly felt a superior aura in any of the other managers I have had, and was a victim of workplace misconduct by the managers on multiple occasions. On the brighter side, I think this job has provided me with immense communication experience, and has helped me break out of my shell and show people my skill and determination to be a good employee and individual in the workplace and outside of that environment as well.",Barista/Cashier,Starbucks,Demanding workplace with ambiguous dynamics between coworkers and managers,"Atascadero, CA; Thousand Oaks, CA","April 6, 2012","benefits, free drinks, knowledge of coffees","management fairness, dramatic relationships"
