3.8,4,Chick-fil-A,26,4.1,3.3,"A typical day consisted of taking orders from customers, cooking, and cleaning. I learned how to treat customers, how to keep a smile on my face even when a customer didn't deserve it, and how to respect everybody. The management team was amazing and never had any issues with classes or my health. They made me feel very comfortable, seeing as I have type 1 diabetes and epilepsy. To this day, I still say ""my pleasure."" I think it is great that after so many years, they still stay closed on Sundays. The hardest part of the job was having to serve mostly college students. They are not always the easiest and a lot of times they can be rude (I was in college for 5 years, nothing against them). The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to walk into work and be happy because of my co-workers, the customers, and just being busy.",3.7,"Restaurants, Travel and Leisure"

Once you're trained to perform one role (i.e.: merchandise), you are able to pick up any shift within the same role at any park. Pay close attention to the training regime-- the majority of this job is independently talking to Guests and navigating the park for them. There will always be either a fellow cast member near by or a coordinator just a phone call away if you ever have questions or need assistance; however, being able to handle situations independently is a huge part of the job.",3.9,"Restaurants, Travel and Leisure"

3.9,3.9,Walt Disney Parks and Resorts,1,4.3,3.9,"If you're looking for a summer job this is it. If you're looking for a way to build your career, you're in for a long hard climb to the top. Immediate management team varies depending on your exact work location in the park, but tend to be good. Management any higher up doesn't know who you are. Can be physically very draining and tends to make your whole life revolve around the parks. Pays a little above minimum wage, but annual raises are the same for all employees at the same level and pay increases with promotions are small. Can get health benefits after working part-time for 3 years or if you achieve full-time status, but you may have to work that long just to get full-time. Everyone is hired in as part-time. Scheduled according to seniority. Work there for at least a year and you will be worked just under the number hours that would qualify you for full-time. Disney will expect you to work your schedule around them. Breaks and lunches are very strictly clocked. Fifteen minutes per break and thirty minutes for lunch (you must use this time to actually go get your lunch too).",3.9,"Restaurants, Travel and Leisure"

I learned that if everyone works together to get something done it makes the job so much easier and less stressful.,3.4,Energy and Utilities
3.6,3.9,Chevron,44,3.8,3.6,The management was wishy washy & they were not flexible with the hours we would have to work. The communication was also an issue.

It taught me how to manage my time efficiently, how to keep personal issues away from work, and how ""the customer is always right."" A typical day at work means that you're probably going to be busy. Although you can be busy, you may not make as much as you think you were going to. 3% of all tips you make go towards bus boys, hosts, and food runners. You wont think 3% is a lot, until you get stiffed on a table and its money coming out of your pocket. Management use to be great, but not as much anymore. They try to comply to your schedule but sometimes they can't and pretty much tell you that you have to come in or you are in trouble. The managers are young and sometimes are not professional at work. The atmosphere at Texas is great. The servers dance every hour to different line dances, and everyone is overall friendly. Texas Roadhouse is definitely the place for large parties. The hardest part of the job is maintaining food running tickets. At the end of the night, if you don't have enough food running tickets, you'll usually have a 2-table section the next night or that coming up weekend.

There were many employees who were under management everyone was overall friendly and very easy to work with. The workplace culture was diverse a little bit of every culture everywhere.
